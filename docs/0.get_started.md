# Get Started
## Installation
1. clone this repo.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/FusionCoders/ManageDent.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the [db](../db/) folder and initialize database
    ```bash
    cd db
    sqlite3 db.sqlite < dental.sql
    ```

This will create the `db.sqlite` database file based on the provided [dental.sql](../db/dental.sql) script.

3. The database is already initialized with **default data** included in the `dental.sql` script. This allows you to test the website immediately.

- **Default accounts**:
  - Assistants and dentists: All default accounts have the password set to `password`.
  - Administrator: Access the admin account using the email `diogobastos@gmail.com` and the password `password`.

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   cd ..
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```
   This command must be executed in the root folder of the repository. This will launch the application locally at http://localhost:8000.
