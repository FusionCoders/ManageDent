# Clinic Management System Overview

- A dental clinic has a website that allows managing information related to scheduled appointments, including dentists, assistants, and patients.

- Each **dentist** has an identification number, name, tax ID, date of birth, salary, specialty, phone contact, email, and office. A dentist may have one or more specialties.

- Each **patient**, in addition to the identification number assigned after registration, also has a name, tax ID, date of birth, phone contact, email, and is assigned a dentist who will follow their entire journey at the clinic.

- An **assistant** also has an identification number, name, tax ID, date of birth, salary, phone contact, and email.

- Each **appointment** is provided by a dentist and an assistant, who attend to a patient. It is essential to know the schedule, day, start time, and end time of the appointment, so that each dentist can be assigned to only one appointment and each assistant can attend a maximum of two simultaneous appointments. The dentist must prepare a **report** describing the appointment, including the procedure and observations.

- The **procedure** performed during the appointment must be within the dentist's **specialties** (implantology, orthodontics, aesthetic prosthetics, periodontics, dental aesthetics, endodontics, pediatric dentistry, treatment planning). If the patient’s assigned dentist does not have the required specialty, the appointment must be exceptionally conducted by another dentist.

- A doctor may also request one or more **machines** for the appointment (X-ray, scanner, etc.). The machine is identified by its reference number and also has a name and brand. Its reservation at a given time cannot overlap with two appointments. A **brand** can produce several machines.

- Both doctors and assistants will have assigned a **schedule** for each working day of the week. An appointment can only be assigned to a doctor and assistant on a given day and time if their working hours match the appointment’s time and day. Each professional's working hours will include the day of the week, start time, and end time. Each doctor and assistant must fulfill a minimum of 32 and 40 weekly working hours, respectively.
