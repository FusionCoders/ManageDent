# Clinic Management System Overview

- The **dental clinic's website** allows the management of information related to scheduled appointments, including dentists, assistants, patients, and the resources involved.

- There are **three levels of access** in the system:
  - **Administrator**: Responsible for managing dentists, assistants, machines, and patients.
  - **Dentist**: Manages patients, consultations, and reports.
  - **Assistant**: Manages consultations and reports but can not add reports to past appointments.

- Each **dentist** has an identification number, name, tax ID, date of birth, salary, phone contact, photo, password, email, and office. Additionally, dentists have an "active" status. This variable allows the system to deactivate their future associations with appointments without affecting their involvement in past appointments.

- Each **patient** has an identification number assigned after registration, name, tax ID, date of birth, phone contact, email, and is assigned a dentist who will oversee their journey at the clinic.

- Each **assistant** also has an identification number, name, tax ID, date of birth, salary, phone contact, photo, password, email, and an "active" status to manage their association with future appointments.

- Each **appointment** involves a dentist, an assistant, and a patient. The system tracks essential details such as schedule, day, start time, and end time. Rules ensure:
  - A dentist and assistant are assigned to only one appointment at a time.
  - Dentists and assistants have their weekly working **schedules** defined (day of the week, start time, and end time), ensuring appointments align with their availability. Doctors must fulfill at least 32 working hours weekly, while assistants must complete 40 hours.

- The dentist must prepare a **report** describing the appointment, including the **procedure** and observations.

- The **machines** used during appointments (e.g., X-ray, scanner) are identified by a reference number, name, and brand. Machines are reserved for specific appointments and cannot be used for overlapping schedules. Each machine also has an "active" status to control future associations without impacting past reservations. A **brand** can produce multiple machines.

- Both dentists and assistants have access to a **calendar** where they can view their scheduled appointments.

> **Note**: While the system initially planned to include functionalities related to dentist specialties (e.g., implantology, orthodontics), this feature has been excluded from the current implementation. However, it remains available in the "Update Profile" section for dentists and is planned for future development. Ideally, the **procedure** performed during the appointment must be within the dentist's **specialties** (implantology, orthodontics, aesthetic prosthetics, periodontics, dental aesthetics, endodontics, pediatric dentistry, treatment planning). If the patientâ€™s assigned dentist does not have the required specialty, the appointment must be exceptionally conducted by another dentist.
