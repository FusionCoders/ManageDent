# ManageDent
This web application efficiently manages dental clinic operations, including appointments, staff, patients, and equipment. It features detailed procedure reports, specialty-based patient-dentist matching, and a secure, role-based login system. Built with PHP, HTML, CSS, and SQLite, the system leverages UML for structural design.
